## OOP PROJECTS:[objects oriented program]ðŸš€
- "OOP" stands for Object-Oriented Programming. It's a programming paradigm that uses "objects" â€“ data structures consisting of data fields and methods â€“ to design applications and computer programs. The key concepts of OOP include encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.
  -   OOP allows for modular and organized code, making it easier to manage and maintain larger software projects.
    ## FEATURESðŸŒŸ
  **Sure! Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) offers several key features that help organize and structure code effectively:**

- Classes and Objects: Classes are blueprints for creating objects, which are instances of those classes. Classes define the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that objects of that type will have.

- Encapsulation: Encapsulation refers to the bundling of data (attributes) and methods that operate on the data within a single unit, called a class. It allows for data hiding, meaning the internal state of an object can only be accessed and modified through well-defined interfaces (methods).

- Inheritance: Inheritance allows a class (subclass or derived class) to inherit properties and behaviors (methods) from another class (superclass or base class). This promotes code reuse and establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes.
